# Ask me anything!

Hi there. My name is Aaron Gustafson and I work on the web.

I am a long-time web developer who is now in charge of Microsoft’s $25m AI for Accessibility grant program. Prior to this role, I was a [web standards](/tags/web-standards/) & [accessibility](/tags/accessibility/) advocate on the Edge browser team, focused on [Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](/tags/progressive-web-apps/).

When not wearing my Microsoft badge, I help organizations elegantly tackle the challenges presented by all the crazy devices and screens you see everywhere using [progressive enhancement](/tags/progressive-enhancement/) via my own consultancy, [Easy Designs](http://easy-designs.net), and [Rosenfeld Media](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/training/). You might also catch me  [presenting at conferences and running workshops](/speaking-engagements/) across the globe.

I sit on the [<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>’s Web Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webapps), where I’m an editor of several PWA-related specifications and the author of numerous feature proposals. In an effort to bring more designers and developers into the standards process, I created [the Web We Want](https://webwewant.fyi). I also co-founded several events, including [PWA Summit](https://pwasummit.org), [Code & Creativity](http://codeandcreativity.com), and [Retreats 4 Geeks](http://retreats4geeks.com). In previous roles, I managed the [Web Standards Project (WaSP)](http://webstandards.org), published [Web Standards Sherpa](http://webstandardssherpa.com), and founded and ran the [Chattanooga Open Device Lab](http://chadevicelab.org).

I wrote the web design book [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://zeldman.com) calls [a “modern classic”](https://alistapart.com/column/doctor-is-in) and [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com) calls [“the clearest, most beautiful explanation of progressive enhancement I’ve ever read”](https://adaptivewebdesign.info#adaptive-web-design-preview): [<cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>](https://adaptivewebdesign.info). I’ve also contributed to [numerous other titles](/publications/#books) and have written [dozens of articles](/publications/#articles). I’ve also helped shape countless others’ written work as Editor in Chief of the esteemed magazine “for people who make websites,” [<cite>A List Apart</cite>](http://alistapart.com).
